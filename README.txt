Note that the code provided might not be the most efficient, as few improvements can still be made, such as:
1. Enhancing the visual / UI of the game
2. Extending the minimax algorithm, as the agent, if there are states that have the same score / value, will choose the first occurance instead of evaluating further which
   state is better on other aspect (for instance, instead of evaluating the min score that leads to the same value as other states, try to evaluate the max score).
3. In impossible mode, the AI can be programmed to prioritize the center position, as it is the most strategic position in initial state, with note that it wouldn't cause the AI to lose
4. Migrating the code to Java whose GUI features are richer while maintaining the high level language nature.
5. Optimization on the Computer move (the process of recursion)
6. Possibility of extending the Tic Tac Toe grid to 4x4, 5x5, and so on (optimization precedence is necessary)

Any change suggestions are gladly accepted.
